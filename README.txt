This is a class for building a UT thesis. It uses standard latex unpacking procedures
for a single dtx file. Running latex on the dtx file will produce all needed files.
Running tex on the dtx file will only produce necessary files (not documentation).
Place at least the .cls in your thesis folder, or in the standard location for
installed tex files.
