\subsection{PHSD model}

Parton-Hadron-String-Dynamics (PHSD) is the only model explored in this thesis that utilizes a \textbf{microscopic transport approach}: it simulates the full space-time evolution of a heavy-ion collision by modeling the interactions of individual particles. Here ``particles'' refers to different quantities (strings, partons, hadrons) which are all evolved in different ways depending on the stage of the collision.
