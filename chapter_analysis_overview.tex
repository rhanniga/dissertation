\chapter{$\Lambda$ Production In and Out-of Jets: Analysis Overview}
This chapter will provide a high-level description of the main analysis topic of this dissertation: using the $\Lambda$ baryon to investigate the origins of strangeness enhancement in p-Pb collisions. First, the goal of this analysis will be clearly stated, along with the steps needed to acheive this goal. Then, each step will be described with more detail, including justification. Finally, the analysis will be summarized, and the next chapter will describe the analysis in more detail.

\section{Objective}
While the phrase ``origins of strangeness enhancement'' is concise, it lacks the specificity required to bring the analysis to fruition. In order to make
