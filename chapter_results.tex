% The final per-trigger $h-\Lambda$ and $h-h$ correlations for each multiplicity bin and $p_{T}$ bin are shown in Figures \ref{h_lambda_dphi_final} through \ref{h_h_dphi_final_highpt}. To gain a better understanding of how each kinematic region evolves with multiplicity, we also provide a summarizing $\Delta\varphi$ plot where zero is not suppressed for each multiplicity bin and $p_{T}$ bin in Figures \ref{h_lambda_dphi_final_full} through \ref{h_lambda_dphi_final_full_highpt}.

% \subsection{$h-\Lambda$, $h-h$ Jet-like Yields}

% In order to investigate the multiplicity dependence of jet-like $\Lambda$ production, the $h-\Lambda$ and $h-h$ near-side and away-side per-trigger pairwise jet yields are plotted for each $p_{T, assoc}$ bin in Figures \ref{final_pairwise_yields} through \ref{final_pairwise_yields_highpt}. The $h-\Lambda$ yield appears to increase by a large amount with respect to multiplicity, whereas the $h-h$ yield appears mostly flat. We can quantify this increase by looking at $Yield_{0-20\%} / Yield_{50-80\%}$ in the two regions for the $h-\Lambda$ and $h-h$, which is shown for each $p_{T}$ bin in Figure \ref{pairwise_plot_increase}. The errors in this plot were calculated using only the $N_{ch}$-dependent systematic errors. We see that across all $p_{T}$ bins, the near and away-side $h-\Lambda$ increase is around 70\%, while the $h-h$ increase never exceeds 30\%. We also observe that the near-side increase is systematically lower than away-side increase, and the the difference between the near and away-side increase is maximized in the lower $p_{T}$ bin (possible medium modification?).

% We also show the same yields plotted against $<\frac{dN_{ch}}{d\eta}>$ with straight-line fits in Figures \ref{final_pairwise_yields_dndeta} through \ref{final_pairwise_yields_highpt_dndeta}. The fits were taken using only the portion of systematic uncertainty that is multiplicity-uncorrelated (shaded boxes). The fits provide optical evidence that the $h-\Lambda$ near and away-side yields appear to converge at higher multiplicity in our lower $p_{T, assoc}$ bin, but the slopes cannot be directly compared to the dihadron case as they depend on the total number of $h-\Lambda$ pairs, which is substantially less than the total number of $h-h$ pairs.

% \subsection{Multiplicity Dependent ($h-\Lambda$)/$(h-h)$ Ratios}

% Once we have extracted the per-trigger pairwise yields from our $h-\Lambda$ and $h-h$ correlations, we are able to measure the ratio of yields of $h-\Lambda$/$h-h$ pairs in each of the kinematic regions described in the previous section--near-side of jet, away-side of jet, underlying event and total yield--as a function of multiplicity. This result of this can be seen for each $p_{T}$ bin in Figures \ref{ratioplot} through \ref{ratioplot_highpt}. Comparing the ratio in different kinematic regions as a function of multiplicity, we see a clear separation between the "jet-like" and "underlying event" components, with the underlying event seeing the largest $\frac{h-\Lambda}{h-h}$ ratio in all multiplicity bins, whereas both the near-side and away-side ratios are lower than the total ratio for all multiplicity bins. We also see a clear separation between the near-side and away-side ratios, with the away-side ratio being higher than the near-side across all multiplicity bins. All kinematic region rations see an increase with respect to multiplicity, but the underlying event ratio sees the smallest increase, while the away-side ratio sees the largest increase.

% This can be quantified even further by plotting vs. $<\frac{dN_{ch}}{d\eta}>$, fitting with a straight line, then extracting the slopes. The results of this can be seen in Figures \ref{final_ratios_dndeta} through \ref{final_ratios_dndeta_highpt}. The fits were taken using only the portion of systematic uncertainty that is multiplicity-uncorrelated (shaded boxes). The slopes of the fits and their corresponding errors are plotted in Figure \ref{final_ratios_slopes}. We see that the underlying event slope is much lower than the near and away-side slopes in our low $p_{T}$ bin, but is consistent with the other slopes in our higher $p_{T}$ bin. We also see that there are no slopes which are consistent with zero, and the slopes tend to increase with $p_{T}$.

% \subsection{Multiplicity Dependent ($h-\Lambda$)/($h-\phi$) Ratios}
% Using previously approved results from the $h-\phi$ analysis (found here: https://alice-notes.web.cern.ch/node/919), we can compare our final ($h-\Lambda, \phi$)/($h-h$) ratios. This comparison is shown in Figure \ref{lambda_phi_comp}. We can also investigate the ($h-\Lambda$)/($h-\phi$) ratio in each kinematic region as a function of multiplicity, which is done in Figures \ref{lambda_phi_ratio} through \ref{lambda_phi_ratio_highpt} (for our central, lower, and higher $p_{T}$ bins). We see from the comparison of the individual ratio plots that both the $\Lambda$ and $\phi$ behave very similarly, with the underlying event ratio dominating across all multiplicity bins. We also observe that the ratios in the jet are lower than the total ratios across all multiplicity bins, with the away side being systematically higher than the near side. However, the $\phi$ ratio in the near side appears much more flat with respect to multiplicity when compared to the $\Lambda$, but this could just be statistical fluctuations.

% In the ($h-\Lambda$)/($h-\phi$) ratio in all $p_{T}$ bins, we see that the ratio in the near side of the jet is systematically higher across all multiplicity bins. We also observe that the ratio in the away side of the jet seems to decrease with respect to multiplicity. For our lower $p_{T}$ bin, we observe that both the near and away side ratios appear to decrease with respect to multiplicity, whereas the underlying event and total ratios appear mostly flat.

% \subsection{Multiplicity Dependent Near- and Away-side Widths}
% Using the techniques described in Section \ref{width_extraction}, we can determine how both the near- and away-side widths evolve with respect to multiplicity for both the $h-\Lambda$ and $h-h$ $\Delta\varphi$ distributions. The final plots of the near- and away-side widths vs. multiplicity percentile can be seen in Figures \ref{width_vs_mult} to \ref{width_vs_mult_highpt}.

% We see that the near-side width is substantially higher than the away-side width across all multiplicity and associated $p_{T}$ bins for both the $h-\Lambda$ and $h-h$ distributions. We also see that the near-side width for the $h-\Lambda$ distribution is higher than the near-side width for the $h-h$ distribution by around 30\% across all multiplicity and momentum bins, whereas the away-side widths are within eachothers systematic errors. We also observe a hint of broadening of the away-side widths with respect to multiplicity, whereas the near-side widths remain more flat. We also observe that the widths become around 15\% more narrow for each region as we increase the associated $p_{T}$ bin.

% \subsection{Model Comparisons}
% \label{model_comparisons}
% In this section, we detail how the results of this analysis in data compare to some of the best p--Pb model calculations. We consider the following models for comparison:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/0012252.pdf}{DPMJet} using LHC18f3
% \item \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.0121.pdf}{EPOS-LHC} using LHC17f2a
% \item \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/0808.0022.pdf}{PHSD} through 200 million events generated using university computing resources
% \end{itemize}

% For each of these comparisons, we apply the same techniques and cuts as they were in data (if applicable). More explicitly, all of the following are kept the same:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Event selection (require $>$ 2 charged hadrons at mid-rapidity)
% \item Multiplicity percentile selection (using charged hadrons in V0A acceptance, more details in Section \ref{model_mult_percentiles})
% \item Trigger and associated $\eta$ range ($|\eta| < 0.8$)

% \item $\Delta\eta$ range ($|\Delta\eta| < 1.2$)
% \item $N_{bins}$ for $\Delta\varphi$ distributions (16 bins)
% \end{itemize}

% We do not apply any of the corrections we used in data (efficiency, two-track effects, etc.) to the models, as they are not required. However, we do apply the standard mixed-event correction procedure to all models except PHSD, whereby we simply remove the single-particle $\eta$ cut on the associated hadron to remove any geometric effects from finite acceptance. This is currently being investigated, as the $h-\Lambda$ 2D distributions in PHSD look a little strange...

% \subsubsection{2D Angular Correlation Distributions}
% \label{model_2d_correlations}

% The multiplicity-integrated per-trigger $h-\Lambda$ and $h-h$ 2D $\Delta\eta\Delta\varphi$ distributions in data and for each model can be seen in Figures \ref{h_lambda_2d_model} ($h-\Lambda$) and \ref{h_h_2d_model} ($h-h$). We also show the $h-\phi$ distributions for each model in Figure \ref{h_phi_2d_model}, but the multiplicity-integrated data is unavailable. While these distributions are never used directly in this analysis, they reveal interesting features of each of the models. 

% For the dihadron correlations, we see zero flow effects with DPMJet, whereas EPOS-LHC massively overestimates the $v_{2}$, with the away-side jet contribution being nearly washed out. PHSD appears to be a nice middleground between the two, with a nearly identical shape to the data (though the per-trigger yield is quite a bit smaller).

% For the $h-\Lambda$ correlations, we again see that there is no $v_{2}$ with DPMJet whereas EPOS-LHC has so much flow that even the near-side jet peak is barely visible. PHSD no longer appears to be a nice middle ground, as there is now a dome-like structure across $\Delta\eta$ that was not present in the dihadron case. 

% The $h-\phi$ distributions tell a similar story as the $h-\Lambda$ distributions, with DPMJet having no flow and EPOS-LHC having too much flow. It also appear as if PHSD is massively underestimating the per-trigger $\phi$ production, which requires investigation.

% \subsubsection{1D $\Delta\varphi$ Correlation Distributions}
% \label{model_1d_correlations}

% The multiplicity-integrated per-trigger $h-\Lambda$ and $h-h$ $\Delta\varphi$ distribution fits in data and for each model can be seen in Figure \ref{1d_modelcomp}. Note that the underlying event has been subtracted off for each distribution, which was done by fitting the near-side of EPOS-LHC and PHSD in the outer ($|\Delta\eta| > 1.2$) region to the following function:
% \begin{equation}
% Fit_{v_{4}} = \sum_{i=0}^{4} a_{i}cos(i\Delta\varphi),
% \end{equation}
% and by the average of 6 non-jet-containing $\Delta\varphi$ bins (1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 16) in the case of DPMJet. An example of the dihadron underlying event fit can be seen in Figure \ref{epos_ue_fit}. In the $h-\Lambda$ case, we are unable to generate fits for EPOS-LHC due to the fact that the underlying event subtraction procedure creates too much noise on the away-side of the distribution.

% \begin{figure}[ht]
% \centering
% \includegraphics[width=4in]{figures/epos_ue_fit.png}
% \caption{An example of the underlying event fit for EPOS-LHC in the dihadron case, taken in the $|\Delta\eta| > 2$ range. Note that even though the $v_1$ and $v_3$ terms were allowed to vary, they were consistent with zero.}
% \label{epos_ue_fit}
% \end{figure}

% For the $h-\Lambda$ distributions, we see that both DPMJet and PHSD underestimate the near- and away-side jet yields, with PHSD being much lower than DPMJet. We also observe that DPMJet appears to underestimate the away-side width, whereas PHSD ``overestimates'' it (though the away-side is barely present in the first place).

% In the dihadron case, we see that no models are able to completely describe the shape of the distribution from data. DPMJet overestimates the near- and away-side peaks, whereas EPOS-LHC underestimates them. PHSD also underestimates the jet-like peaks, but is closer to the data than EPOS-LHC.

% \label{1d_modelcomp}

% Due to difficulties with statistics (PHSD) and constraining the underlying event contribution (EPOS-LHC and PHSD), we will only be considering DPMJet for the following sections.

% \subsubsection{Generating Multiplicity Percentiles}
% \label{model_mult_percentiles}
% As our final results are multiplicity-dependent, we must first sort our model-generated events into similar multiplicity percentiles as in data. To do this, we simply count the number of charged hadrons within the acceptance of our V0A detector (2.8 $< \eta <$ 5.1) for each event and use the corresponding distribution to generate the percentiles. The resulting distribution for each model can be seen in Figure \ref{model_mult_percentiles_figure}.

% \begin{figure}[ht]
% \centering
% \begin{subfigure}{

% \label{model_mult_percentiles_figure}
% \end{figure}

% With the events sorted into multiplicity percentiles, we can now compare our final analysis results to the model(s). As mentioned previously, we will just be focusing on DPMJet for now.

% \subsubsection{Systematic Uncertainties for DPMJet}
% \label{dpmjet_systematics}
% While most of the systematics considered for this analysis are not relevant for model predictions, both the yield extraction procedure and width extraction procedure have systematics that should be taken into account. We provide a table of the systematic uncertainties in each multiplicity bin for our central momentum bin for DPMJet in Tables \ref{dpmjet_systematics_table_lambda} ($h-\Lambda$) and \ref{dpmjet_systematics_table_h} ($h-h$).

% \label{pairwise_yields_modelcomp}
% The per-trigger pairwise jet-like yields for both the $h-\Lambda$ and $h-h$ distributions  as a function of multiplicity for each associated $p_{T}$ bin in data and using DPMJet can be seen in Figure \ref{pairwise_yields_modelcomp_figure}.

% We see that DPMJet does a fairly good job predicting the dihadron near- and away-side yields, but severely underestimates the $h-\Lambda$ yields. We also observe no multiplicity dependence for DPMJet in any of the distributions, which is in stark contrast to the $h-\Lambda$ data.

We have elected to exclude the total ratio, as it crowds the plot (and can be inferred by the other ratios). 

% We see that DPMJet actually manages to preserve the relative ordering of the ratios in each kinematic region, with the underlying event on top, followed by the away-side jet and then the near-side jet. However, DPMJet underestimates the magnitude of the ratios in each kinematic region, and each ratio also shows little-to-no dependence on multiplicity. The jet-like ratios also appear to increase with increasing $p_{T}$, whereas the underlying event ratio appears constant.

We have elected to exclude the total ratio, as it crowds the plot (and can be inferred by the other ratios). 

% Like data, DPMJet shows a clear separation between the underlying event and the jet-like ratios. However, DPMJet underestimates the magnitude of the ratios in each kinematic region. Furthermore, DPMJet also shows little-to-no difference between the near-side and away-side ratios. DPMJet also exhibits very little multiplicity or $p_{T}$ dependence for the ratios in each region.

% We see that DPMJet is mostly able to reproduce the near-side widths of the $h-h$ distributions for each associated $p_{T}$ bin, but underestimates the near-side widths of the $h-\Lambda$ distributions. DPMJet also underestimates the away-side widths of both the $h-h$ and $h-\Lambda$ distributions for each associated $p_{T}$ and multiplicity bin. There is also no observable multiplicity dependence for either the near- or away-side widths in DPMJet for every associated $p_{T}$ bin.

% \section{Cross Checks}
% \subsection{Resonance Technique for $\Lambda$ Reconstruction}
% \label{resonance_technique}

% \textbf{THIS SECTION NEEDS TO BE UPDATED TO REFLECT TWO-TRACK TEMPLATE USAGE AND BR CORRECTION, but the consistency between the two techniques should NOT CHANGE}

% While using the V0 finder to reconstruct $\Lambda$ baryons is the most common method, it is possible that the V0 finder algorithm introduces some topological biases in the $\Lambda$ reconstruction, even when no further topological cuts are being applied to the V0 or its corresponding daughters. Because of this, we also investigate another method for reconstructing $\Lambda$ baryons whereby all proton and pion pairs from the global AOD track list that pass the daughter cuts (Section \ref{daughtercuts}, but we require a TOF hit to reduce combinatorial background) within an event are combined to reconstruct the $\Lambda$s. This method is referred to as the \textit{resonance technique}, as it is the technique used to reconstruct short-lived particles that could otherwise not be reconstructed using the V0 finder.

% \subsubsection{Combinatorial Background Estimation}
% \label{combinatorial_background}

% As $\Lambda$ baryons reconstructed using the resonance technique will have a large combinatorial background, the final correlation will contain $h-(p\pi)$ pairs that need to be removed. In order to remove this background, we need both an estimate of the correlation shape of the $h-(p\pi)$ pairs, as well as an estimate of the Signal/Background in the $\Lambda$ mass peak region.

%  The background shape of the $\Lambda$ invariant mass distribution can be estimated using one of the following techniques:

%  \begin{itemize}
% 	\item \textbf{Like-sign $p\pi$ pairs} - Reconstruct the invariant mass of like-sign $p\pi$ pairs, and scale the like-sign $p\pi$ distribution to the un-like sign $p\pi$ distribution in a region outside of the $\Lambda$ signal region.
% 	\item \textbf{Rotated $p\pi$ pairs} - Reconstruct the invariant mass of unlike-sign $p\pi$ pairs, but rotate either the pion or proton around the z-axis by $\pi$ radians, and scale the rotated $p\pi$ distribution to the un-like sign $p\pi$ distribution in a region outside of the $\Lambda$ signal region.
% 	\item \textbf{Voigt + polynomial fit} - Perform a standard fitting procedure using TMath::Voigt for the signal along with a second-order polynomial for the background.
%  \end{itemize}

% We will address the last technique (fitting procedure) first, as it fails to properly estimate the signal and background in data. To illustrate this, we can find the best possible fits in data and extract the corresponding signal shape to compare with the signal shape in MonteCarlo (with full track reconstruction). This comparison is done for our 20-50\% multiplicity bin in Figure \ref{resonance_fitting_comp}.

% \clearpage
% \begin{figure}[ht]

% \begin{subfigure}{
% \includegraphics[width=3in]{figures/lambda_mass_20_50_resonance_fit.pdf}}

% \end{subfigure}
% \caption{Left: Invariant mass distribution with corresponding Voigt + Polynomial fit in our 20-50\% multiplicity bin (data). Right: Our signal and background shapes in MonteCarlo (MC). Note that even though MC appears to have a completely different S/B, the signal shapes should be similar. Our fit in data appears to be massively underestimating our $\Lambda$ signal, as our MC sample indicates we have $\Lambda$ signal where our total data fit converges with our BG fit.}
% \label{resonance_fitting_comp}
% \end{figure}

% The MonteCarlo plot was generated using our standard MC sample, and applying the same techniques for $\Lambda$ reconstruction described previously using the global AOD list. The background on the plot was generated by taking all $p\pi$ pairs that did NOT come from a $\Lambda$, verified within the MC stack. While comparing data to MonteCarlo should be done with caution, it should also be pointed out that even extracting the $\Lambda$ signal in MonteCarlo without a priori knowledge of the background shape is nontrivial and naive attempts result in severely underestimating the signal.

% While it may be possible to get a proper handle on the background shape using the fitting procedure, all attempts by the author to do so have failed. Because of this, we will only consider the first two techniques for the rest of this analysis. To determine which of the two remaining techniques is more effective, we compare the background shape of the $\Lambda$ invariant mass distribution for both techniques in MonteCarlo where we have direct access to the background shape. The like-sign and rotated $p\pi$ pairs are shown along with the extracted signal comparison in Figure \ref{background_approx_MC}. The like-sign $p\pi$ pairs match the background shape of the $\Lambda$ invariant mass distribution more closely than the rotated $p\pi$ pairs, so we use the like-sign $p\pi$ pairs to estimate the combinatorial background in the $\Lambda$ invariant mass distribution in data.

The true combinatorial background (red) matches most closely with the like-sign pairs. Right: The actual $\Lambda$ signal (magenta) compared with the result of subtracting the like-sign from the total unlike-sign $p\pi$ distribution (green). The two distributions show good agreement.}
% \label{background_approx_MC}
% \end{figure}
	
% The region outside of the $\Lambda$ signal region used for scaling the background estimates is called the Right SideBand region, or RSB. The choice of RSB has a large systematical effect on the background approximation as neither the like-sign nor rotated $p\pi$ pairs match the background shape throughout the entirety of the distribution. The RSB region was chosen to minimize the difference in shape between the extracted signal in data (total - like-sign BG) and the resonance-technique reconstructed signal shape in MonteCarlo, generated from all $p\pi$ pairs which guaranteed came from a $\Lambda$. The raw unlike-sign $p\pi$ distribution for the 0-20\% Multiplicity Percentile, and a comparison of the extracted signal with MonteCarlo, is shown in Figure \ref{res_invariant_mass_0_20}.

% \end{figure}


% \subsubsection{Invariant Mass Regions}

% The signal shape and background from $\Lambda$s reconstructed using the resonance technique is vastly different than those reconstructed using the V0 finder, thus it is necessary to define new invariant mass regions such that the signal can be properly extracted:

% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item \makebox[7.5cm][l]{unlike-sign $p\pi$ in $\Lambda$ mass region:}  \SI{1.014}{GeV/c^2}$< M_{p\pi} < $\SI{1.026}{GeV/c^2}
% 	\item \makebox[7.5cm][l]{like-sign $p\pi$ in $\Lambda$ mass region:}  \SI{1.014}{GeV/c^2}$< M_{p\pi} < $\SI{1.026}{GeV/c^2}
% 	\item  \makebox[7.5cm][l]{unlike-sign $p\pi$ in 0-20\% multiplicity bin RSB:}  \SI{0.995}{GeV/c^2}$< M_{p\pi} < $\SI{1.005}{GeV/c^2}
% 	\item  \makebox[7.5cm][l]{unlike-sign $p\pi$ in 20-50\% multiplicity bin RSB:}  \SI{0.995}{GeV/c^2}$< M_{p\pi} < $\SI{1.005}{GeV/c^2}
% 	\item  \makebox[7.5cm][l]{unlike-sign $p\pi$ in 50-80\% multiplicity bin RSB:}  \SI{0.995}{GeV/c^2}$< M_{p\pi} < $\SI{1.005}{GeV/c^2}
% \end{itemize}

% The signal regions were chosen to maximize significance and were not multiplicity dependent, whereas the RSB regions were chosen to minimize the difference in shape between the extracted signal in data (total - like-sign BG) and the resonance-technique reconstructed signal shape in MonteCarlo, generated from all $p\pi$ pairs which guaranteed came from a $\Lambda$, as was demonstrated in Figure \ref{res_invariant_mass_0_20}. This process was repeated for each multiplicity bin resulting in slight fluctuations of the RSB with respect to multiplicity.



% For the resonance technique, the combinatorial background contribution to the correlation was removed using the like-sign $p\pi$ distribution scaled to the RSB for each multiplicity bin, a procedure described with more detail in Section \ref{removecomb}.

% \subsubsection{Efficiency Correction}
% To estimate the $\Lambda$ reconstruction efficiency, we compare $\Lambda$ yields reconstructed using the resonance technique to the true $\Lambda$ yields using the MC production LHC17f2b\_FAST (anchored to LHC16q\_FAST production). The efficiency was calculated using the following formula:

% \begin{align*}
% 	\varepsilon_{\Lambda} &=  \frac{N_{\Lambda\text{, reco. with resonance technique}}}{N_{\Lambda\text{, real MC yield}}},
% \end{align*}

% where each $\Lambda$ in $N_{\Lambda\text{, reco. with resonance technique}}$ is found in the following way:

% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item Find all protons and pions within the AOD list that pass our daughter cuts (Section \ref{daughtercuts}, PID is done via MC label)
% 	\item For each proton in list, determine if it came from a $\Lambda$ (via MC label)
% 	\item If proton came from $\Lambda$, loop through pions until we find one that came from same $\Lambda$ (via MC label)
% 	\item Reconstruct the $\Lambda_{reco}$ using the daughter AOD tracks
% 	\item Only keep $\Lambda_{reco}$ if $|\eta| < 0.8$
% \end{itemize}

% and each $\Lambda$ in $N_{\Lambda\text{, real MC yield}}$ meets the following criteria:

% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item Found in the MC stack
% 	\item $|\eta_{\Lambda}| \leq 0.8$
% 	\item The $\Lambda$ decays to $p\pi$
% \end{itemize}

% While previous analyses focus solely on primary $\Lambda$s (excluding $\Omega$ and $\Xi$ contamination), there is no requirement for either the V0-reconstructed $\Lambda$ or the MC-generated $\Lambda$ to be a primary particle. As this analysis is mostly interested in the $\Lambda$ due to its strange quark content, whether or not the $\Lambda$ came from a cascade decay is irrelevant. This is important to note when making comparisons between this analysis and previous analyses, as secondary contamination from cascades accounts for nearly 20\% of all $\Lambda$s.

% As mentioned in Section \ref{lambda_reconstruction}, both the $\Lambda$ and the $\bar{\Lambda}$ were combined together for this efficiency calculation. Efficiencies were calculated as a function of $p_T$, $\eta$, $\varphi$, Event Z vertex, and Multiplicity. However, the final efficiency correction was applied as a function of $p_T$ only and can be seen in Figure \ref{lambda_eff}.

% \begin{figure}[ht]

% \caption{Efficiency vs. $p_T$ for $\Lambda$ reconstruction using resonance technique for each multiplicity bin, along with an integrated 0-100\% point in red. There does not appear to be any significant dependence on multiplicity. Also worth nothing that the efficiency is higher for this technique when compared to the V0 technique, as expected (all AOD tracks from V0 finder daughters are also in total AOD track list).}
% \label{lambda_eff_res}
% \end{figure}

% The $h-\Lambda$ pairwise efficiency correction is applied in the same way as described in Section \ref{trigassoc_efficiency}.

% \subsubsection{Mixed Event Acceptance Correction}
% \label{mixed_event_res}
% The procedure for correcting for finite detector acceptance in our angular correlations is exactly the same as the one described in Section \ref{mixed_event_correction}.


% \subsubsection{Removal of Combinatorial $p-\pi$ Background}
% \label{removecomb}

% Since we do not know which $p-\pi$ pairs came from a real $\Lambda$ decay, we must remove the contribution to the angular correlation structure due to the combinatorial background of $p-\pi$ pairs that did not come from a $\Lambda$.

% To do this, h-($p\pi$) angular correlations are measured for unlike-sign $p\pi$ pairs within the right sideband (RSB) for each multiplicity bin. The correlation structure in the RSB is then normalized to its integral to give an estimate of the combinatorial background shape, as the RSB should contain little-to-no $p\pi$ pairs that came from a $\Lambda$. The self-normalized 1D $\Delta\varphi$ distributions for different choices of RSB regions are shown in Figure \ref{normRSBcomp}. As the shapes are similar for each choice of RSB, we conclude that there is no substantial contribution from $p\pi$ pairs coming from $\Lambda$ decay.

% \begin{figure}[ht]
% \centering
% \includegraphics[width=4in]{figures/h_lambda_dphi_rsbcomp_0_20.pdf}
% \caption{The projected $\Delta\varphi$ distributions for different choices of RSB within the $-1.2 < \Delta\eta < 1.2$ region. The correlation shapes are identical within the statistical errors.}
% \label{normRSBcomp}
% \end{figure}

% For the remainder of this resonance technique analysis we will be using $1.16 < M_{RSB} < 1.18$ as our choice of RSB region for each multiplicity bin. 

% Next, the $h-p\pi$ angular correlation in our chosen sideband region is scaled to match the integral of our background in our signal region. However, this scaling is not performed directly as while the Signal/Background and Signal/(Signal + Background) ratios are the same for the single-particle $\Lambda$ distribution and its corresponding invariant mass axis in our $h-\Lambda$ distribution, the total yields are different. We therefore scale the $h-p\pi$ distribution in the RSB to the BG integral in our signal region found using the following formula:

% \begin{align}
% 	h-p\pi \text{\space Combinatorial BG} = (\text{Integral of \space} h-p\pi \text{\space in Signal Region}) \times (1 - \frac{S}{S+B}),
% \end{align}

% where $S$ and $B$ are calculated in the Signal region using the single-particle $\Lambda$ distributions from Table \ref{res_invariant_mass_0_20}.

% Once the $h-p\pi$ angular correlation in the RSB is scaled to match the $h-p\pi$ Combinatorial BG, it is subtracted from the total $h-p\pi$ distribution in our signal region, then scaled to correct for our finite signal region. This scale factor is calculated using the following formula:

% \begin{align}
% 	s_{\text{finite region}} = (\text{Integral of residual in signal region} / \text{Total integral of residual})^{-1}
% \end{align}

% Once the scale factor is applied, we are then left with the full $h-\Lambda$ 2D angular correlations and corresponding 1D $\Delta\varphi$ projections, shown in Figures \ref{resonance_2d_correlations} and \ref{resonance_1d_correlations}, respectively.

% \subsubsection{Results and Comparison with V0 Technique}
% The per-trigger near and away-side pairwise yields vs. multiplicity for the $h-\Lambda$ and $h-h$ distributions are shown in Figure \ref{final_pairwise_yields_resonance}.The final $h-\Lambda$/$h-h$ ratio vs. multiplicity plot for $\Lambda$s reconstructed using the resonance technique is shown in Figure \ref{final_ratio_resonance}. A comparison of the final per-trigger $h-\Lambda$ $\Delta\varphi$ correlation structure for the resonance and V0 techniques can be seen in Figure \ref{resonance_v0_dphi_comp}. The correlation shapes are nearly identical, with the resonance technique having slightly larger uncertainties due to the combinatorial background subtraction. While this is not surprising (a $\Lambda$ is a $\Lambda$, regardless of how it is reconstructed), it serves as a powerful cross check to our central values from the V0 technique.

% \subsection{Single Trigger $h-\Lambda$, $h-h$ Correlations}

% \textbf{THIS SECTION NEEDS TO BE UPDATED TO REFLECT TWO-TRACK TEMPLATE USAGE AND BR CORRECTION, but the final conclusion does NOT CHANGE}

% As our technique does not directly give the yields of the associated particles, it could be possible that event-by-event fluctuations in the number of trigger particles could lead to small differences between the number of associated pairs and the number of associated particles. To be more explicit, if there are two triggers and two associated particles in a single event, the correlation measurement will give a yield of four trigger-associated pairs, while the number of associated particles is only two. 

% Furthermore, if there are two triggers corresponding to two separate jets in an event, we would be misplacing the true kinematic regions of our trigger-associated pairs: if one of the trigger-associated pairs lies in the near-side jet, it's possible when that associated particle gets correlated with another trigger, it would be placed in the "underlying event". We can get a rough estimate of how often this occurs by looking at the number of triggers per event, shown in Figure \ref{trigs_per_event}.

% \begin{figure}[ht]
% \centering
% \includegraphics[width=4in]{figures/trig_per_event.pdf}
% \caption{A log-plot showing the number of triggers per event across our data sample. Only a small fraction of events have at least a single trigger, and of those events, only a small fraction have more than one trigger}
% \label{trigs_per_event}
% \end{figure}

% While events with multiple triggers ($> 1$) are rare--less than 5\%-- an additional crosscheck was performed to investigate the effect of using multiple triggers within an event has on our final measurement. For this crosscheck, we perform the exact same analysis as demonstrated in this note, but we only use a single trigger hadron for each triggered event. If the event has multiple triggers, we select the trigger with the highest momentum within our $4 < p_{T} < 8$ Gev/$c$ range. The final per-trigger $\Delta\varphi$ distributions for each multiplicity bin are shown in Figures \ref{h_lambda_dphi_singletrigger} ($h-\Lambda$) and \ref{h_h_dphi_singletrigger} ($h-h$). The ratio of the single-trigger $\Delta\varphi$ distribution to the total-trigger $\Delta\varphi$ distribution for each multiplicity bin for both the $h-h$ and $h-\Lambda$ correlations is shown in Figure \ref{singletrigger_ratio}.

% As the single-trigger/total-trigger ratio is flat for both the $h-h$ and $h-\Lambda$ distributions across all multiplicty bins, the effect on our final yield and ratio measurements would only be a change of scale.  As this scale factor is the same across all multiplicity bins, we conclude that using our standard per-trigger correlation method accurately captures the behaviour of the $\Lambda$/$h$ ratio in the different kinematic regions with respect to multiplicity.

% \subsection{MonteCarlo Closure Tests}
% \label{mc_closure}
% In order to test the validity of our correction techniques, we performed a standard MonteCarlo closure test for our $h-h$, $h-\Lambda_{v0}$ and $h-\Lambda_{res}$ $\Delta\varphi$ distributions using our standard MC dataset in the 0-80\% multiplicity percentile. In this test, we generate two types of correlation functions. The first is generated using the same analysis technique and corrections described in this note on the reconstructed AOD tracks in the MC dataset: we will call this the ``reconstructed'' distribution. The second is generated using the same analysis technique, but with the particles coming directly from the MC stack: we will call this the ``ground-truth'' distribution. We then take the (reconstructed)/(ground-truth) ratio of these distributions, which should be consistent with unity if our corrections are valid.

% For the $h-h$ reconstructed case: 
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Both the reconstructed trigger and associated hadron pass the track cuts described in Sections \ref{trigcuts} and \ref{assoccuts}, respectively 
% \item The trigger and associated hadrons were also required to have a corresponding particle in the MC stack, with that particle being physical primary.
% \item The PDG codes of the MC stack particles were verified to be corresponding to either a pion, proton, kaon, electron or muon (with corresponding anti-particles).
% \item The trigger hadron is taken to be between $4 < p_{T} < 8$ GeV/c and the associated hadron between $2 < p_{T} < 4$ GeV/c. 
% \item The efficiency and acceptance corrections are applied in the same was as described in Sections \ref{reconstruction_efficiency} and \ref{mixed_event_correction} (using a reconstructed mixed-event distribution). 
% \item The final $\Delta\varphi$ distributions are taken in the range $-1.2 < \Delta\eta < 1.2$
% \end{itemize}

% For the $h-h$ ground-truth case: 
% \begin{itemize}
% \item The trigger and associated hadrons were taken from the MC stack 
% \item The trigger and associated hadrons were verified via PDG codes to be either a pion, proton, kaon, electron or muon (with corresponding anti-particles).
% \item The trigger and associated hadrons were required to be physical primary particles.
% \item The trigger and associated hadrons were required to fall within $|\eta| < 0.8$.
% \item The trigger hadron is taken to be between $4 < p_{T} < 8$ GeV/c and the associated hadron between $2 < p_{T} < 4$ GeV/c. 
% \item The acceptance corrections are applied in the same was as described in Section \ref{mixed_event_correction} (using a ground-truth mixed-event distribution). 
% \item The final $\Delta\varphi$ distributions are taken in the range $-1.2 < \Delta\eta < 1.2$
% \end{itemize}

% The final reconstructed and ground-truth $h-h$ $\Delta\varphi$ distributions along with a (reconstructed)/(ground-truth) ratio and straight-line fit shown are shown in Figure \ref{h_h_mc_closure}. The ratio is systematically higher than one due to secondary contamination (which is a $< 2$\% effect), but is consistent with unity. We conclude the corrections applied to the $h-h$ distributions are valid.

% \end{figure}


% \clearpage

% For the $h-\Lambda_{res}$ reconstructed case, even though it has not been corrected for the two-track merging effect, we see that the non-closure is gone and the ratio is consistent with unity, implying the track merging inefficiency does seem not affect $\Lambda$s reconstructed using the resonance technique. This is likely due to two factors:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item The resonance technique has a much lower S/B, and therefore the sideband subtraction introduces a large amount of statistical fluctuations
% \item The reconstructed daughter tracks have a larger fraction of higher quality tracks when compared to the V0 technique, and those tracks are less likely to be merged over by the trigger during reconstruction
% \end{itemize}

% To elaborate on the second point, while the resonance and V0 techniques use the same loose quality cuts (Section \ref{daughtercuts}), the daughter tracks coming from the V0 finder have a fairly major topological constraint: the V0 finder algorithm must be able to resolve a secondary vertex. While the $\Lambda$ decay length ($c\tau = 10 cm$) is fairly large, it is important to remember that decay length distributions are exponential ($e^{-t/\tau}$), and therefore there are a significant amount of $\Lambda$s that decay close enough to the primary vertex that the V0 finder cannot resolve a secondary vertex. Such $\Lambda$s are successfully reconstructed by the resonance technique, and their corresponding tracks will have a higher quality than those reconstructed by the V0 finder.

% To further investigate this surprising closure of the $h-\Lambda_{res}$ distribution, we perform the same closure test as described above, but for our reconstructed $h-\Lambda_{res}$ distribution, we require that reconstructed $\Lambda$ have a corresponding entry in the MC stack, making our combinatorial background exactly 0 and removing the need for sideband subtraction. The results of this test are shown in Figure \ref{h_lambda_mc_closure_res_no_sideband}. We see now that the ratio is no longer consistent with unity at small $\Delta\varphi$, but with a much smaller non-closure when compared to the V0 technique, as expected.

% \subsection{Dihadron Comparison with $\phi$ Correlation Analysis}
% As both this analysis and the $\phi$ correlation analysis are run over the same data set, with the same cuts being used on both the trigger and associated particles, we would expect the corresponding dihadron $\Delta\varphi$ correlations from both analyses to be the same. As theses analyses are being performed by humans with vastly different coding styles, we should do a thorough comparison of the final dihadron correlations to ensure they are indeed identical. The final per-trigger dihadron $\Delta\varphi$ distributions in each multiplicity bin for both the $\phi$ and $\Lambda$ analyses are shown in Figure \ref{dihadron_comparison}, with their corresponding ratios shown in Figure \ref{dihadron_ratio_comparison}. The dihadron distributions are identical for both analyses, as expected.

% \subsection{ZYAM Baseline Projected onto $\Delta\eta$}
% It has been observed in previous analyses (Figure 6 from \url{https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.08979.pdf}) that the baseline extracted using the ZYAM technique on the corresponding $\Delta\varphi$ distributions is often higher than the what the baseline would be if you were to extract it from the $\Delta\eta$ distribution instead. This is an important consideration, as in principle our ``underlying event'' baseline should contain no correlated pairs in both $\Delta\eta$ and $\Delta\varphi$, and if the ZYAM technique is extracting a baseline that is higher than it should be (and it is our lowest baseline of all the techniques), then it is possible that the baseline from all of our techniques are actually being contaminated by correlated pairs.

% As the away-side ridge is present across the entirety of our $\Delta\eta$ range, a true minimum would never be obtained by projecting the entire $\Delta\varphi$ range. Instead, we project only the near-side component ($|\Delta\varphi| < \pi/2$) onto the $\Delta\eta$ axis, as was performed in the analyses mentioned at the beginning of this section. Plots containing these projections for each multiplicity bin can be seen in Figures \ref{h_lambda_deta_zyam_comparison} ($h-\Lambda$) and \ref{h_h_deta_zyam_comparison}  ($h-h$). We observe that the baseline extracted from the $\Delta\varphi$ distributions is in relatively good agreement with the baseline that would be extracted from the $\Delta\eta$ distributions if the ZYAM technique were applied. However, there appears to be a slight multiplicity dependence on the difference between the two baselines, as for higher multiplicity the $\Delta\varphi$ ZYAM baseline is lower than the minimum $\Delta\eta$ bin for both the $h-\Lambda$ and $h-h$ case, whereas at our lowest multiplicity we observe that the $\Delta\varphi$ ZYAM baseline is higher than the minimum $\Delta\eta$ bin for both cases. This is likely due to the small $v_{2}$ contribution that occurs at higher multiplicties, which pushes the ZYAM baseline obtained from the $\Delta\varphi$ distributions upwards.
